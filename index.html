        <Header>About Me</Header>
<paragraph>Hey! I'm Alice i'm 20 years old and i'm origionally from Fredericton New Brunswick. 
    I moved to Ottawa two years ago in a search for something different. I moved here specifially 
    to join the IMD program and it's taken me this long to actually do it. I wanted to get into this
    program so badly because there's no courses like this one in NB and this course will teach me the 
    basics of being an animator and a digital designer.</paragraph>
<paragraph> Moving to Ottawa not only allowed me to get into the program I wanted it also made me run into 
    the most amazing partner and bestfriend I could have ever asked for. We first met at work, we were bboth in the same 
    department. Unfortunaly they were my managers favorite and I was her least. That fact alone made it very hard for us
    to get to know eachother. But that didn't stop us, asker work they would always drive me home and we'd go
    out for coffee all the time. After a couple months we decided to move in together and there has never been a 
    boring day. I'm finaly in a healthy environment, my mental health has never been better and i've met the person
    I can trust the most.</paragraph>
