<paragraph>Hey! I'm Alice i'm 20 years old and i'm origionally from Fredericton New Brunswick. 
    I moved to Ottawa two years ago in a search for something different. I moved here specifially 
    to join the IMD program and it's taken me this long to actually do it. I wanted to get into this
    program so badly because there's no courses like this one in NB and this course will teach me the 
    basics of being an animator and a digital designer.

<paragraph>
    Little facts about me are that im a Taurus, i'm a huge cat person and I hate celery.
