            <p>Hey! I'm Alice I'm 20 years old and I'm originally from Fredericton New Brunswick. I moved to Ottawa 
                two years ago in a search for something different. I moved here specifically to join the IMD program 
                and it's taken me this long to actually do it. I wanted to get into this program so badly because there's 
                no courses like this one in NB, and all I ever wanted to be is an animator and a graphic designer.</p>
          <p>Moving to Ottawa not only allowed me to get into the program I wanted it also made me run into 
            the most amazing partner and bestfriend I could have ever asked for. We first met at work, we were both in the same 
            department. Unfortunately, they were my managers favorite and I was her least. That fact alone made it very hard for us
            to get to know each other. But that didn't stop us, after work they would always drive me home and we'd go
            out for coffee all the time. After a couple months we decided to move in together and there has never been a 
            boring day since. I'm finally in a healthy environment, my mental health has never been better and I've met the person
            I can trust the most.</p>
